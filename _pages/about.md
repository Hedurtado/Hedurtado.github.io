Hello! I’m Edwin Hurtado, a passionate Mathematics student at Yachay Tech University in Ecuador, with a focus on algebra, topology, and computational methods. My curiosity lies at the intersection of theoretical mathematics and practical problem-solving, driving me to develop innovative solutions for real-world challenges.

Throughout my academic journey, I have co-founded projects like Math2Braille, where I developed a Python program to convert mathematical documents into Braille, making education more accessible to visually impaired students. I am also actively involved in Signify, a project dedicated to teaching American Sign Language through a mobile app, further reflecting my commitment to using technology for social good.

When I’m not immersed in coding or math problems, you’ll find me tutoring, teaching, and sharing knowledge with others. I believe in the power of collaboration and education to make a positive impact.

Feel free to explore my projects, publications, and experiences as I continue on this journey of learning and creating!
